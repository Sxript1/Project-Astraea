## Outreach Tiers

### Tier 1: Pillars (High-Level Vision & Leadership)
- **SpaceX** — Focus on launch architecture, timeline, and Starship integration.
- **The Planetary Society** — Public engagement, crowdfunding campaigns, advocacy.
- **Caltech / JPL** — Scientific mission design, navigation expertise, and credibility.

**Goal:** Secure buy-in and strategic alignment with these foundational partners to create a stable project core.

---

### Tier 2: Builders (Technical Development & Systems Integration)
- **Northrop Grumman** — Orbital assembly, deployable structures, in-space servicing.
- **Airbus Defence and Space** — European collaboration, satellite construction, habitat modules.
- **JAXA** — Solar sail R&D, sail deployment expertise.
- **NASA Langley & Marshall Centers** — Materials testing, solar sail mission concept validation.

**Goal:** Engage technical partners with detailed proposals to develop, test, and build mission-critical systems.

---

### Tier 3: Community (Academic Research & Scientific Validation)
- **MIT** — Structural engineering, control systems, human-machine interface design.
- **University of Arizona (Lunar and Planetary Laboratory)** — Science goals definition, resource prospecting instruments.
- **Broader Academic Institutions** — Formation of Science Working Groups to refine mission concepts.

**Goal:** Build a collaborative academic network to maximize scientific output and broaden expertise.

---

## Timeline & Next Steps
- **Immediate (0-3 months):** Reach out to Tier 1 partners to establish strategic vision and roles.
- **Short-Term (3-9 months):** Begin technical discussions with Tier 2 partners; identify key R&D projects.
- **Mid-Term (9-18 months):** Formalize Science Working Group; initiate collaborative research proposals.
- **Long-Term:** Maintain ongoing communication and expand partnerships as project phases evolve.

## Notes
- Tailor messaging to each partner’s interests and capabilities.
- Use public engagement (via The Planetary Society and social media) to build broader support.
- Regularly update all partners on progress via newsletters, reports, and meetings.
