## 🌌 About the Project

This repository contains all materials related to **Project Astraea**, a visionary proposal for a **solar sail-powered star galleon**.

The core of this project is a detailed engineering plan and interactive proposal that reimagines long-duration space travel. Our goal is to outline a feasible architecture for a *"workhorse"* interplanetary vehicle that can establish a **persistent, low-cost logistics network** throughout the solar system.

The interactive site (`index.html`) translates the formal white paper into an engaging experience, detailing the mission, the key technologies, and the path forward.
